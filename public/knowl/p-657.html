<p>Some presentations can be assisted by a hint from the author about the lengths of the titles.  You can choose to provide a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">width</code> attribute on a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dl</code> element with possible values <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">narrow</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">medium</code>. The value refers (somewhat confusingly) to the distance between the left margin and the description.  The default is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">medium</code>, which is illustrated above. Conversion to <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> ignores the attribute.  An example with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">narrow</code>:</p>
<dl class="description-list narrow">
<dt>Red</dt>
<dd><p>The color of the sun at sunset.</p></dd>
<dt>Blue</dt>
<dd><p>The color of a clear sky. Also a synonym for “depressed or sad”, the title of a 1971 Joni Mitchell album (and more than a dozen other musical albums), the period of Picasso's work between 1901 and 1904, and much more!</p></dd>
<dt>Aqua</dt>
<dd><p>The color of shallow tropical waters.</p></dd>
<dt>Math <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span>
</dt>
<dd><p>Sorry, not a color but testing titles with math in them.</p></dd>
<dt>“i” before “e” except after “c,” unless it sounds like “a” as in “neighbor” and “weigh”</dt>
<dd><p>Get feisty about that weird counterfeit rule: seize the day and don't have a heifer, man.</p></dd>
<dt>Avocado</dt>
<dd><p>Avocado is the the color with hex code <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">#568203</code>, and also the main ingredient in guacamole.</p></dd>
<dt>Magenta</dt>
<dd><p>Magenta is a color, and a character in Rocky Horror.</p></dd>
<dt>Zymurgist</dt>

<dt>Byzantium</dt>

<dd><p>No literary detective ever said “Elementary my dear Watson.”  In particular, Sherlock Holmes never said that.</p></dd>

<dt>Washington</dt>
<dd><p>A state, a district, the man on the US $1 bill and on the US quarter. Did you ever notice that on the US dime, the value is stated as “one dime”? But how is one to know that a dime is worth 10 cents?</p></dd>

<dt>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</dt>
<dd><p>George Santayana wrote those words in 1905.  A similar aphorism is misattributed to Winston Churchill.  The idea is embodied in the 4th principle: PreTeXt respects the good design practices which have been developed over the past centuries.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-s} \)</span></dt>
<dd><p>The Riemann <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\)</span>-function is defined by a Dirichlet series, valid for <span class="process-math">\(\Re(s) &gt; 1\text{.}\)</span></p></dd>

<dd><p>A <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">dl</code> with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">width="narrow"</code> might be a useful way to give commentary on a program listing.</p></dd>
