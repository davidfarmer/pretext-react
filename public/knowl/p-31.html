<p>Abstract mathematics is different from other sciences. In laboratory sciences such as chemistry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theories.  Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments.  In studying abstract mathematics, we take what is called an  axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection of objects <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\mathcal S\)</span> and assume some rules about their structure.  These rules are called <dfn xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="terminology">axioms</dfn>.  Using the axioms for <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\mathcal S\text{,}\)</span> we wish to derive other information about <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(\mathcal S\)</span> by using logical arguments.  We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one another.  We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too restrictive,  there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.</p>
